== COMMON ERROR MESSAGES

This error can occur if you develop on Jetty but deploy to JBoss and Jettyâ€™s web.xml file does not match the web.xml used for JBoss. You need to manually update the web.xml files (e.g., after adding a bean xml path) in both the JBoss config directory (_src/main/config/jboss/web.xml_) and the one used by Jetty (_src/main/config/web.xml_) so that the values match.

Remember that if you use an Entando image for Openshift, JBoss, or Wildfly, these images will also use the web.xml in the JBoss config directory.
