Working through tne documentation highlighted some gaps for me.

1. When migrating a database, rather just create a new database with a different name. We could have a version number in the database name itself and simply
  point the new image to the new database. Drop the database a version or two ago.

2. Implement recreation of databases on PostgreSQL based on the build number. Make the build number sequential.

3. Implement a version of our EAP S2I image that can do the database migration described in #1

4. Add KUBE_PING protocol support in the templates for clustered deployments
